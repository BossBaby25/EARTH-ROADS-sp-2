    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>The Utah Engineering Experiment Station was established by an Act of
            the State Legislature in March 1909, as a department of the State
            School of Mines, the engineering college of the University of Utah.
            The station is authorized “to carry on experiments and investigation,
            pertaining to any and all questions and problems that admit of
            laboratory methods of study, and a solution of which would tend to
            benefit the industrial interests of the State, or would be for the
            public good.”</p>

        <p>Just now in the State of Utah the problem of good roads—how to
            construct and maintain them—is prominent in the public mind. As a
            contribution to the discussion of this problem Professor Richard R.
            Lyman of the Engineering Experiment Station staff offers the subject
            matter of this bulletin. The publication and distribution of such
            an article is clearly within the province of the privileges of the
            station. It is hoped that this contribution will help solve the problem
            of good roads in Utah.</p>

        <p>Bulletin No. 1, now out of print, was on “Tests on Utah Brick,” and No.
            2 was on “Tests of Macadam Rock.” The next bulletin to be published
            will be tests on the cements on the Utah Market. So long as they last
            bulletins of this Station will be sent free, upon application.</p>

    <p>Great institutions, great movements, and great advances in science
        grow, they do not spring into existence instantly. So it will be with
        the installation of good roads—the system must grow. No legislation
        can be enacted that will bring into existence suddenly a fine system of
        well made and well maintained highways. The beginning must be at the
        bottom where even the best legislation can give no more than a good
        beginning and then, by the vigorous application of work and wisdom, a
        system of roads may be constructed that will be not only the pride of
        the citizens of the state, but a source of education, prosperity, and
        pleasure. Education, because good roads will make it easy for boys and
        girls to get to the grade schools, and young men and young women to
        the high schools at all seasons of the year; prosperity, because farm
        products can be put in the market when the price is highest, and teams
        can be used profitably at other work when they cannot be used on the
        farm; pleasure, because of the comfort with which, at all times, those
        in the country can travel, thus making it possible to have and enjoy
        the many social advantages offered in the club, the church, and the
        neighbor’s home.</p>

    <p>When, by enacting into law the best road legislation it can, the
        legislature has made a beginning, it is then the duty of the people to
        begin to learn more concerning roads and their maintenance. It may be
        well, in the imagination, to picture hard roads leading everywhere,
        but, advocating their construction at once and working ever so
        vigorously to this end, will probably delay rather than advance this
        work, for the reason that the cost of their maintenance is such that,
        if these roads were already constructed, it would be impossible in this
        state at present to keep them in good condition. It will take years of
        education to teach the people to place that value upon good roads that
        will induce them to spend, both in the construction and maintenance of
        highways, even a small fraction of the sum it would require to keep in
        repair an extensive system of hard roads in Utah. Farmers see at once
        when their actual cost is presented, that to make such outlays is, for
        them, utterly and absolutely impossible.</p>

    <p>First in the natural development of a system of highways comes the
        earth road, and since a good road of this character is the very best
        foundation for all kinds of better highways, it may be considered, not
        only as a road complete in and of itself, but also as an important part
        of every good road. When the people throughout the state have been so
        taught and trained in road construction that they can and do actually
        construct and maintain earth roads in good condition, the foundation
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
        will then be laid for some, or in fact for any better road, and the
        time will have arrived in which the construction of roads with hard
        surfaces of some sort can be taken up appropriately and perhaps
        effectively.
    </p>

    <p>The discussion on roads, road construction, and road maintenance of
        the past few years has pretty well demonstrated that people generally
        are of the opinion that the roads should be improved and that with the
        general improvement of the roads will come a corresponding improvement
        in the prosperity and general uplifting of the people in the country
        districts; yet, while the opinion is general that roads should be
        improved, there is a vast difference of opinion as to what is the best
        method to follow to reach the desired end.</p>

    <h3>Hard Roads.</h3>

    <p>Men with money and automobiles are vigorously urging that road-building
        materials everywhere be tested, that road graders, stone crushers,
        and other expensive road-building machinery be purchased, and that
        the preparation for commencing road construction be begun at once. In
        short, they are conducting a vigorous campaign in the interest of hard
        roads—and in so doing, they may defeat their own cause now as they
        have done in the past. “When the hard road enthusiast began to tell
        the farmer how much it cost him to haul his produce to market,” says
        Professor Baker, “and how much he could save by the construction of
        hard roads, he knew instinctively that the conclusions were ridiculous,
        and the continual harping upon these false statistics and absurd
        estimates led him to believe that an attempt was being made to force
        hard roads upon him, whether or no, and his attitude changed from one
        of indifference to one of open hostility to all road improvement.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
            class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>What, then, should be the line of procedure? “Unless a community is
        willing and able to maintain the earth roads in a reasonably good
        condition,” says Professor Baker again, “it is useless to expect that
        it will be willing or able to support a high class wagon road; and
        therefore, the dissemination of correct information concerning the
        construction and care of earth roads is politically, economically, and
        physically the first step towards a better form of construction.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
            class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

    <p>An earth road to be a good road must be “dry, smooth, and hard.” These
        three conditions could be maintained with comparative ease if the earth
        road could be protected from water, which is its greatest destroyer and
        one of the most important factors in the destruction or deterioration
        of all roads.</p>

    <p>Since in Utah the rainfall is very small, compared with that in the
        Eastern states and in the states of the Mississippi valley, the road
        problem is a much simpler one here than there.</p>

    <h3>Drainage.</h3>

    <p>If not actually the most important, certainly the drainage of a road is
        one of the most important factors to be considered in the construction
        or in the maintenance of that road.</p>

    <p>A system of underdrainage is a necessity, where the surface water comes
        near the top of the ground on which a road is to be built, and drain
        tile laid longitudinally on boards to a carefully and properly made
        grade will carry such water away. Fortunately however, for the builders
        of roads in Utah there are comparatively few such places where roads
        need to be maintained in this state. Drain tile, however, laid in soft
        material, without the use of a board or plank to keep the ends of the
        individual pieces of pipe in line, is practically valueless.</p>

    <h3>Standard Cross-Sections.</h3>

    <p>It is a small amount of precipitation or rainfall only that the road
        builder here must take care of. Very wisely the last legislature passed
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
        a law establishing standard cross-sections for the roads in this state.
        Figures <a href="#FIG_1">1</a>, <a href="#FIG_2">2</a>, <a href="#FIG_3">3</a>,
        <a href="#FIG_4">4</a>, <a href="#FIG_5">5</a> and <a href="#FIG_6">6</a>
        show in a clearer way what these cross-sections are, than these can be
        shown in the law by the use of words only.
    </p>

    <p>The elevation of the crown of the road above the fence line varies
        from four inches to eighteen inches, the amount depending on the width
        of the street, and the depth of the drain ditches on the sides of the
        roadway is as shown some two feet below the grade of the fence line.</p>

    <p>The roadways and sidewalks as the figures giving the cross-sections
        show, all have such slopes, that water falling upon these surfaces will
        flow quickly into the drain ditches.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Road Grades.</h3>

    <p>Some of our country roads in Utah have been very well constructed as
        far as the cross section is concerned, but no particular attention
        has been paid to the grade of the road in the direction of its length
        except when work has been done to reduce the grade on steep pitches.</p>

    <p>Roads should have a grade or slope of about 1 to 80, or 1¼ per cent,
        in the direction of their length, so that water will not remain in any
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
        small ruts that may be formed, but will flow along them to a point
        where it will flow from the rut into the drain ditch.
    </p>

    <h3>Drain Ditches.</h3>

    <p>The slope of the drain ditches should be the same as the slope of the
        road and their cross-sections should be practically the same at all
        points, so that all the water flowing into them will flow promptly to a
        nearby cross drain that will carry it entirely away from the road.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img id="FIG_5" src="images/image006a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="155" />
        <p class="f200"><b><i>Seven Rod Street</i></b></p>
        <p class="f150 space-below2"><i>Fig. 5</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>In many cases unsightly, uneven holes are dug on either side of the
        roadway in order to secure material for making the crown of the road
        and the water, which gathers in these, keeps the foundation under the
        road always soft.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img id="FIG_6" src="images/image006b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="136" />
        <p class="f200"><b><i>Eight Rod Street</i></b></p>
        <p class="f150 space-below2"><i>Fig. 6</i></p>
    </div>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
        Cross-drains should be provided at all “low places.” Culverts should be
        constructed under the roadway at these points to carry the water from
        the upper to the lower side of the road.</p>

    <p>If storm water is carried quickly well away from a road, the condition
        of that road for traveling will be greatly improved. But rain and other
        storms do not generally put roads into their worst condition. This
        comes in the spring time, when the frost “comes out of the ground.”
        Observation shows, however, that not much frost gets into dry ground,
        so that if a road is properly maintained during the fall, and the fall
        and winter storm water is promptly drained well away from the road,
        frost can do the road very little damage. It cannot loosen up the
        earth, rendering it soft and mushy, as it does earth that is filled
        with moisture. To make good earth roads in the spring, therefore, requires
        good drainage and careful maintenance during the fall and winter.</p>

    <p>The average country road in Utah can be constructed with its center
        raised six inches for from $40.00 to $50.00 per mile. To raise the
        crown of the road six inches more above the sides will cost about the
        same amount.</p>

    <h3>Maintenance.</h3>

    <p>Even more important than a proper construction of a road is the
        proper maintenance of that road. There is a difference, too, between
        maintenance and repair. The one keeps the road in good condition
        always, the other puts it in good condition occasionally. “What a
        minute and a shovelful of earth will do as maintenance may require
        loads of earth and hours of time as repairs.”</p>

    <p>The road grader with its inclined blade, its four wheels, and its
        comparatively complex machinery, when used for maintaining or repairing
        an earth road merely cuts off the high places and deposits in the low
        places, the earth thus cut away.</p>

    <h4>Devices for Maintenance.</h4>

    <p>The leveler, a frame-work of planks held on edge and drawn in the
        direction of the length of the road with three or four of the timbers
        at right angles to this direction, renders good service by taking off
        the high places and filling up the low ones. The weight of this device
        and the greater width of its timbers, make it pack the earth into low
        places better than the road grader does. But since the blade of the
        grader can be set at such an angle with the direction of the road that
        it will constantly carry the earth from the outer edge toward the crown
        of the road, it makes the center of the road high, as it should, while
        the leveler makes it flat.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

        <p class="f150 space-below2"><i>Fig. 7</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>The triangular shaped drag has, to a certain degree, the good qualities
        of both the devices just named, but what is generally regarded as the
        best device for repairing and maintaining earth roads is the King road
        drag or the split-log drag.</p>

    <p>Practically all the good qualities of all the other devices used up to
        this time for maintaining earth roads are found in the split-log drag.</p>

    <p><a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a> shows the drag with the doubletree
        attached, and therefore it shows the position of the team drawing
        the drag with respect to the drag itself. The diagonal brace between
        the two heavy timbers near the forward end is used to keep the end
        of the timber which travels ahead from vibrating. The chain by which
        this device is drawn may be attached directly to the front timber or
        it may be extended through holes in this timber and be attached to
        the timber in the rear. If, instead of passing through the hole A
        (<a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>.) the chain is carried over this timber
        and attached to the timber B, more room will thus be made for earth in
        front of the drag to slide under the chain.</p>

        <p class="f150 space-below2"><i>Fig. 9</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>The angle the sides of the drag make with the direction of the road can
        be varied at pleasure by attaching the doubletree to different links of
        the chain.</p>

    <p>The teamster will soon learn by experience that changing his position
        as he rides on the drag will affect the work of the drag very
        materially, and he will soon learn also how and when to change his
        position in order to obtain the best results.</p>

    <h4>Importance of Using Drag.</h4>

    <p>The proper and best use of this drag or the careful maintenance of the
        ordinary earth road is perhaps the most important lesson in “roads”
        Utah people have to learn at this time. It is more important than the
        actual grading or construction of these roads.</p>

    <h4>When to Use Drag.</h4>

    <p>This drag should be used upon the road after every heavy rain and after
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
        every big thaw as faithfully as the successful dry-farmer harrows his
        crop at these same times.
    </p>

    <p>Fortunately, too, the road dries faster than the farming land, so that
        the work on the roads can be completed before teams can, to advantage,
        be taken upon the farms to work.</p>

    <p>Professor Ira. O. Baker of the University of Illinois, in an excellent
        article on the maintenance of roads in the Transactions of the American
        Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. LXI., gives a description and also
        drawings of the split-log drag. His drawings are reproduced in Figs.
        <a href="#FIG_7">7</a>, <a href="#FIG_8">8</a>, and <a href="#FIG_9">9</a>.
        He describes the drag as follows:
    </p>

    <p>“Farmers in different parts of the country for many years, have used
        various devices occasionally in smoothing the surface of the earth
        roads; but of all these, none seems to have devised a better form of
        machine or been more persistent and intelligent in its use than Mr.
        D. Ward King, of Maitland, Mo. Mr. King devised what he calls the
        split-log drag. A plan of the split-log drag as shown in <a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a>,
        and <a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8</a> is a perspective view. The drag may be
        made from a log ten or twelve inches in diameter and from seven to
        nine feet long. A light wood, like elm, is preferable to a heavy one,
        like oak. The cross braces may be round or square sticks from three to
        four inches in diameter, the ends fitting into two-inch auger holes.
        A board, not shown in the cut, is laid upon the cross-pieces for the
        driver to stand upon. The drag may also be made of two pieces of plank,
        ten or twelve inches wide and from seven to nine feet long. The plank
        drag is shown in <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>. It is wise to reinforce
        the wide planks with either a 1 by 6-in. or a 2 by 6-in. strip as shown
        in <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

    <p>The drag is drawn by two horses, and its length should be proportional
        to the weight of the horses. A drag seven feet long is about right for
        a team of 1200-lb. horses, and one nine feet long for two 1600-lb.
        horses. The driver rides upon the drag, and varies its effect by his
        position upon it. The drag does the best work when the soil is moist,
        but not sticky. If the roadway is badly rutted and full of holes, it is
        well to drag it when the surface is slushy.”</p>

    <h4>Common Mistakes With Drag.</h4>

    <p>Mr. King, the government expert on the split-log drag,
        says:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
        “Two mistakes are commonly made in constructing a drag. The first lies
        in making it too heavy. It should be so light that one man can easily
        lift it. Besides, a light drag responds more readily to various
        methods of hitching and to the shifting of the position and weight of
        the operator. *** A drag can be made heavier at any time by proper
        weighting.</p>

    <p>The other mistake is in the use of square timbers, instead of those
        with sharp edges, whereby the cutting effect of sharp edges is lost
        and the drag is permitted to glide over instead of to equalize the
        irregularities in the surface of the road. ***”</p>

    <h4>Iron on Drag.</h4>

    <p>“A strip of iron about 3½ feet long, three or four inches wide and
        one-quarter of an inch thick may be used for the blade. This should
        be attached to the front slab so that it will be one-half inch below
        the lower edge of the slab at the ditch end, while the end of the iron
        toward the middle of the road should be flush with the edge of the
        slab. The bolts holding the blade in place should have flat heads and
        the holes to receive them should be counter-sunk.</p>

    <p>If the face of the log stands plumb, it is well to wedge out the lower
        edge of the blade with a three-cornered strip of wood to give it a set
        like the bit of a plane.”</p>

    <p>Mr. Chas. H. Hoyt of the U. S. Office of Public Roads,
        says,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
        “The split-log drag is a very simple affair, costs $2.00 to build, is
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
        economical to use, and every farmer or teamster living along a country
        road, who is interested in having the road past his place kept in good
        condition and is also interested to keep highway taxes down, should
        have a split-log drag.”
    </p>

    <p>To maintain in this way all the important rural roads will make it
        necessary to put to work many of the teams that are idle when this work
        should be done. Perhaps some system can be devised that will require
        each farmer to maintain that portion of road in his neighborhood,
        and for so doing he may be exempt from paying a cash road tax.
        Those who prefer to do so can pay the tax in money, and the funds
        thus derived can be used to pay for the general supervision of this
        maintenance-work, and for the actual work of maintenance on the roads
        where farmers do not care to do the work themselves.</p>

    <h3>Earth or Macadam Road.</h3>

    <p>Since the hard, dry, smooth earth road is an excellent road, and
        since it is possible with reasonable effort to induce the people to
        construct and maintain such a road from one end of this state to the
        other, with a good many side roads of the same sort on the way, why
        not strive for this possible end, instead of attempting to get a few
        miles of hard road constructed? Such a road could be pointed to with
        pride by every citizen of the state in the presence of any citizen of
        any other state. Would it not be better to have a well constructed and
        carefully maintained earth road from Logan to St. George, a distance
        of 350 miles, than to have the best tar macadam road for a distance
        of 37 miles between Ogden and Salt Lake City? The longer road would
        cost $25,000 with many interested and willing people to pay for it,
        while the other would cost thirty-seven times as much with fewer people
        personally interested in it. Every farmer between Logan and St. George
        drives upon the public highway, while many persons in the larger cities
        rarely, if ever, do.</p>

    <h4>Cost of Roads.</h4>

    <p>An ordinary macadam road two rods wide costs about $20,000 per mile;
        a tar macadam road about $25,000 per mile; an asphaltum pavement some
        $44,000 per mile; a gravel road, covered with gravel one foot deep,
        costs from $1,600 to $5,000 per mile, and the cost of constructing an
        earth road the same width varies from $40 to $100 per mile.</p>

    <p>While the figures given are the costs of constructing various roads two
        rods wide, this occasion is taken to emphasize the fact that a road
        sixteen feet wide is broad enough in most country districts, while in
        sparsely settled parts even narrower roads will answer all actual needs
        very well.</p>

    <h4>Ordinary Macadam.</h4>

    <p>Ordinary macadam pavement is composed of carefully selected stone and
        gravel thoroughly rolled into a compact mass, with the material so
        graded that the coarsest stones are on the bottom and the finer binding
        material is on the top. Such a roadway proved very satisfactory until
        the general advent of the automobile. In order to resist the digging or
        scratching effect of the driving wheels of high speed motor cars, which
        is technically called the shear, it is necessary to use tar or some
        other binding material for holding the particles of stone more firmly
        together.</p>

    <h4>Tar Macadam.</h4>

    <p>Tar macadam roads are constructed the same as other macadam roads,
        except that the top layers of broken stone are covered with hot tar
        before they are rolled into place.</p>

    <h4>Costs Compared.</h4>

    <p>If $70 per mile be taken as the cost of constructing an earth road two
        rods wide, the cost of building one mile of gravel road will build some
        fifty miles of earth road; one mile of ordinary macadam will build 300
        miles of earth road; one mile of tar macadam will build 360 miles of
        earth road; and one mile of asphalt pavement will construct 600 miles
        of earth road.
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
    </p>

    <h3>The Earth Road a Portion<br /> of Better Roads.</h3>

    <p>An important argument in favor of the earth road is the fact that when
        it is laid out and constructed, it is the beginning of a first-class
        gravel road, a first-class macadam road, or a first-class tar macadam
        road, so that by getting the earth road made, the individual interested
        primarily in the construction of hard roads has succeeded in getting
        the hard road well begun.</p>

    <h4>Roads in Sand and Soft Clay.</h4>

    <p>While nearly everywhere in Utah the soil is such that it will make a
        good earth road, there are parts in which the soft clay is filled with
        alkali, and there are other parts where there are extensive stretches
        of sand. Neither of these alone can be made into an earth road that
        will be a good, passable road all the year round. The sand road is
        best in wet weather, while the alkali road is best in dry weather.
        If, however, the soft clay and the sand are so mixed on the road that
        the clay just fills the openings or interstices between the grains of
        sand, and yet this quantity is not so large as to keep the grains of
        sand from touching or coming in contact with one another, the road, if
        properly and constantly maintained, will be a good one.</p>

    <h4>Cost of Maintenance.</h4>

    <p>Since proper maintenance is an important part of the work on ordinary
        roads, its cost will be considered briefly.</p>

    <p>The repairs and maintenance on an asphalt pavement cost from 9 to 60
        cents per square yard annually, or for a two rod road the cost is from
        $1,750 to $11,600 per mile per year; on a tar macadam road the cost is
        from $2,000 to $4,000 per mile per year; on a gravel road it is about
        $40 per mile per annum, while for $5 per mile per year an earth road
        can be kept in a condition of repair that will surprise those who have
        not used the split-log drag on such a road.</p>

    <p>As already stated, narrower roads will answer all necessary demands in
        many parts, and maintaining such will reduce the cost proportionately.
        A well kept narrow road is infinitely better than a broad one in bad
        condition.</p>

    <h4>Earth Roads Poorly Kept.</h4>

    <p>Concerning the maintenance and the construction of roads, Mr. Charles
        H. Hoyt of the United States Office of Public Roads, writes:<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"
            class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
        “It is sad when we have to say that because of neglect the roads that have
        already been built have been allowed to go to pieces and have not been
        properly maintained. Even our ordinary dirt roads are horrible examples
        of this statement.”</p>

    <p>On the value to a community of good roads, Mr. Hoyt says, in the same
        article: “Any country which longer continues to insist upon remaining
        stagnant concerning highways, will soon be classed behind the times and
        avoided by progressive citizens.”</p>

    <p>Mr. D. Howard King, Expert on Split-log Drag, Office of Public Roads,
        has prepared a bulletin called Farmers' Bulletin, No. 321, on “The Use
        of the Split-Log Drag on Earth Roads.” All who are interested in this
        subject should secure a copy of this excellent paper from the United
        States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., and make a careful
        study of the same.</p>

    <h4>Drag Reduces Dust.</h4>

    <p>On the use of this drag the bulletin says, in part: “Clay, when
        mixed with water and thoroughly worked, becomes remarkably tough
        and impervious to water. If compacted in this condition it becomes
        extremely hard. Another valuable result of dragging is the reduction
        of dust, for the particles of clay adhere so tenaciously that there is
        but little wear when the surface is smooth. Dust on an earth road is
        due to the breaking up under traffic of the frayed and upturned edges
        of ruts and hoof prints. If the surface is smoothed after each rain and
        the road dries hard and even, no edges are exposed to crushing, and the
        only dust which forms is that due to actual wear of the road surface.”
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Examples and Their Cost.</h3>

    <p>The bulletin quotes Mr. F. P. Sanborne<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
        as follows: “The least expense per mile (for dragging) was about $1.50;
        the greatest, a little over $6; the average expense per mile for five
        and one-half miles, a little less than $3.” Continuing, Mr. Sanborne
        says: “The writer has lived by this piece of road all his life, and
        although we have had the extremes of weather this season, both wet and
        dry, not for forty years has the road in question been so free from mud
        and dust. Parties who have known the road all their lives are agreed
        that it never was in so good a condition a season through.”</p>

    <p>“The total expense for twelve months on twenty-eight miles of road in
        Iowa,” continues Mr. Hoyt, “averaged $2.40 per mile, and the roads were
        reported to have been 'like a race track' the larger portion of the
        year.</p>

    <p>A number of farmers in Ray county, Missouri, employed one of their
        number to drag a five-mile stretch. He received compensation at the
        rate of $3 per day. When the end of the year came and a settlement was
        made, the cost for the year was found to be $1.66 per mile. The road is
        a tough clay, and my informant declares it was always much better than
        the other roads in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>Prof. William Robertson of the Minnesota Agricultural station, after
        a year's experience in dragging a 'main road made entirely of gumbo,
        without any sand or gravel, and which during the past year has shown
        no defects either by rutting or development of soft places,' fixes the
        cost of the work at not to exceed $5 per mile.”</p>

    <p>Since in Maine, Iowa, Missouri and Minnesota, the four states just
        referred to, there is a comparatively great annual rainfall, while in
        Utah the rainfall is comparatively small, the cost of maintaining the
        earth road in Utah will be correspondingly less and the results will be
        proportionately greater.</p>

    <p>If the state legislature, the Automobile Club of Utah, some other
        organization or some philanthropic individual, will offer an annual
        prize of $1000 to the county actually constructing and maintaining
        during the year the best five miles of earth road, the number of
        excellent roads that will be built in the next few years will be a most
        pleasant surprise to all who are anxious to see good roads constructed.</p>

    <p>The better, and, in fact, the best roads will come along naturally
        after we have a first-class system of earth roads built and well
        maintained generally throughout the state. When once the efforts of all
        our good-roads enthusiasts are united on constructing and maintaining
        first-class earth roads everywhere, the road problem in Utah will be
        solved, and our road systems will be the pride of the whole state.</p>
